Code:
```{.haskell include=1u.hs liquid=inplace}
```
Constraints:
```{.haskell include=1u.cons}
```
Relevant Constraints:
```{.haskell include=1u.mycons}
```
p:
```{.haskell include=1u.p}
```
`p` is UNSAT, so we interpolate
```{.haskell include=1u.i}
```
Our z3 query (and response):
```{.scheme include=1u.smt2}
```
